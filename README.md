Tap the "Back" button to navigate back to the Main screen
Tap the "Clear Input" button to clear user input and re-input data
DEVELOPMENT

The app was developed using Android Studio and Kotlin programming language. The app utilizes parallel arrays for data storage and loop calculation for average temperature.

UTILIZATION OF GITHUB AND GITHUB ACTIONS

The development process of the Meteor Minds App benefited greatly from the use of GitHub and GitHub Actions. Version Control: GitHub served as a central repository for storing and managing the app's source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the project simultaneously. Branching Strategy: Branches were utilized for feature development and bug fixes, enabling parallel development without interfering with the main codebase. Code Review: Pull requests were used for code review, facilitating collaboration and ensuring that changes met quality standards before being merged into the main branch. Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions were implemented for automated testing and building, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the app. CI pipelines were set up to automatically run tests and generate build artifacts upon each commit, reducing the risk of regressions and ensuring that the app functions as intended

CODE STYLE AND FEATURES The development of the app leverages Kotlinâ€™s object-oriented programming capabilities and the Android development framework (Kotlin, n.d; Android Studio, n.d). The app utilizes several programming concepts to provide a smooth user experience (Kotlin, n.d.).
